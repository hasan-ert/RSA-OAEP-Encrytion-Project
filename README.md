# RSA-OAEP-Encrytion-Project
An end-to-end encrytion application for messages
This basic messaging program is designed for the practice of end-to-end protection algorithm with a method similar to RSA-OAEP.

It uses a web server to send messages to users, therefore, it will not work when the sever is closed.
However, the main focus here is the encryption algorithm itself rather than the functional messaging
